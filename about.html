            <h3>Where my current interests came from</h3>
            <p>
              In my high school years, I met some amazing people who helped me
              become who I am today. It was at this time I found out about the
              fourth year in tech and chose to pursue it after high school. In
              the third year, I got especially interested in tech businesses
              such as tesla and their tech. I also started to look into the
              stock market and other ways to pursue wealth and other sources of
              income. I am a very creative person and that is why I really liked
              our game-developing program in high school.<br />
              <br />
              I developed a game for my high school exam together with my friend
              which turned out pretty good for our first game. My interest in
              front-end development and game design grew during the last two
              years of high school.
