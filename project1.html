              <h3>Where my current interests came from</h3>
              <p>
                In my high school years, I met some amazing people who helped me become who I am today. 
                It was at this time I found out about the fourth year in tech and chose to pursue it after high school. 
                In the third year, I got especially interested in tech businesses such as tesla and their tech. 
                I also started to look into the stock market and other ways to pursue wealth and other sources of income. 
                I am a very creative person and that is why I really liked our game-developing program in high school.<br />
                <br />
                I developed a game for my high school exam together with my friend which turned out pretty good for our first game.
                 My interest in front-end development and game design grew during the last two years of high school.
